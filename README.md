# JAMStack personal blog

This is a personal blog site for writing down and sharing my thoughts and learnings.

This project is based of Kevin Powell's tutorial.

## Tutorial

You can [watch this video](https://youtu.be/4wD00RT6d-g) to see how Kevin Powell uses Eleventy, Netlify, and Netlify CMS to create a full-featured blog site built entirely with static files.

## About the Project

The provided files are finished pages using regular HTML and CSS. The HTML files can be broken down into pieces, and used to build out the different templates and partial files using a templating language of your choice.

The `src` folder contains files so that you can get your project up and running without worrying about content for posts/articles. That folder contains:

- HTML files to use as a base for the different page layouts. These can be turned into the templates that will be used.
- CSS file for styling the pages
- Blog articles in the `blog` folder
- images and a logo in the `assets` folder

The articles are written in Markdown, and include Front Matter. Depending on the Static Site Generator you use, it is possible that you will have to modify these a little if you wish to use them.
